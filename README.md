# Sorting algorithms
In this work, the following data sorting methods were implemented: <br/>
* Selection sort,
* Insertion sort,
* Exchange (bubble) sort,
* Shell sort,
* Tournament sort,
* pyramid sort,
* Quick sort <br/>

The complexity and efficiency of each sort was also assessed. A comparison was made with Python's built-in sorting
